# Redux-Toolkit-and-RTK-Query 

## Redux -
Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing the state of an application in a predictable way. It is commonly used with libraries like React for building user interfaces but can be used with any JavaScript framework or library.

## Toolkit -
The official opinionated, batteries-included tool set for efficient Redux development

## Store -
A store is a central place where the state of our application is stored and it can be created using the configureStore function, and it holds the entire state tree of our application.

**Note -** A store is not a "class". Itâ€™s just an object with a few methods on it. To create it, pass your root reducing function to createStore.

## Store Methods

- getState()

- dispatch(action)

- subscribe(listener)

- replaceReducer(nextReducer)
